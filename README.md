# Matrix_multiplication

In this proyect i had implemented, different executions of a matrix multiplication and do an analisys of the time comsuption.

At the firts part, the implementation correspond to a OPENMP parallel execution on complete matrix. While at the second part, I work with superior matrixes. Where I test OPENMP parallel executions with differents schedules (Static, Dynamic and Guide).
